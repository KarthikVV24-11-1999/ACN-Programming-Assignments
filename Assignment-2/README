How to run:
Provide output file paths, metric and optimism manually:
	./sample.sh <topology_file_path> <connections_file_path> <routingtable_file_path> <forwardingtable_file_path> <paths_file_path> <metric> <optimism>


Provide only input file paths and obtain all outputs:
	./script.sh <topology_file_path> <connections_file_path>

Both the scripts sample.sh and script.sh run the python file run.py to obtain the outputs. In case of sample.sh, the outputs are created/rewritten as per the given file paths. In case of script.sh, the outputs are given names according to the metric and optimism and are placed in a folder called output. Do not remove the folder output at any time.

Sample inputs:
sample_inputs: Contains a small topology with 3 nodes and 3 edges and connections are 6
sample_inputs_2: Contains the 14 node NSFNET and 24 node ARPANET topologies and connections of 100, 200 and 300 for each
The outputs corresponding to each pair of topology and connections for NSFNET and ARPANET are placed in respective output folders.
